# MERN Stack Project Repository

## Overview
This repository comprises projects developed during a structured **learning and placement preparation phase** focused on the **MERN Stack**. The objective of this repository is to apply theoretical knowledge through practical implementation while developing a strong understanding of backend systems, RESTful API design, server-side processing, and basic frontend integration.

The repository is maintained as a continuous learning record and will be updated with additional projects as development skills and technical depth progress.
